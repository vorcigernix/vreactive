    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>
      Battle for the Net is a first iteration of hackathons created by
      ReactiveConf. Our main goal is to make an event with a positive impact on
      our society. We believe that technology is a great tool to help other
      people and every year we will aim to raise awareness about problems we see
      around us and turn this awareness into action. And, yes, we want to have a
      lot of fun too. This year, the event is created in collaboration with
      Socialbakers, one of most successful startups in Czech Republic.

    <h3>Participants</h3>
    <p>
      You are very motivated and skilled developer, designer or a marketing
      person. You will be working together in a multidisciplinary team
      delivering the whole thing on the market. While our mentors work usually
      in javascript and InVision, we donâ€™t want to limit your tools to anything
      specific. This is battle for a net, fight with anything you can use.

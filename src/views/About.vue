    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>
      Battle for the Net is a first iteration of hackathons created by
      ReactiveConf. Our main goal is to make an event with a positive impact on
      our society. We believe that technology is a great tool to help other
      people and every year we will aim to raise awareness about problems we see
      around us and turn this awareness into action. And, yes, we want to have a
      lot of fun too. This year, the event is created in collaboration with
      Socialbakers, one of most successful startups in Czech Republic.

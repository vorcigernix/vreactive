      <h3>Challenge</h3>
      <p>
        Build a website. On our first collaboration with ReactiveConf, we made a
        digression from advanced topics like Machine Learning and Enhanced
        Realities we had before. Kind of. Your challenge would be to create a
        perfect website for very specific purpose we will unveil on the event.
        Don’t be afraid, nothing is easy in a life of developer.
      </p>
      <h3>Competition rules</h3>
      <p>
        We will measure (with generally used tools) User Experience and
        technical parameters of a website. Think of Lighthouse. This will be 30%
        of a points you can get. Our Mentor will add a personal opinion based on
        subjective criteria like graphical design, which will account for
        another 30% of points. These subjective points will be judged from a 15
        minute pitch of every team at the end of the event. Other 40 percents
        will be measured from a success of the page on market. Again, details
        will be explained on the hackathon.
      </p>
      <h3>Prize</h3>
      <p>
        We’ll be blunt here. If you are in for a money, you are in a wrong
        place. We are doing this for fun and we want to return the original
        meaning to the Hackathon events. This is not an easy way to make a money
        for skilled developers and we are not doing hire-a-thon. That being
        said, there will be prize that can change a life. Maybe not yours though
        :-)
      </p>
      <h3>Participants</h3>
      <p>
        You are very motivated and skilled developer, designer or a marketing
        person. You will be working together in a multidisciplinary team
        delivering the whole thing on the market. While our mentors work usually
        in javascript, typescript, python and Sketch, we don’t want to limit
        your tools to anything specific. This is battle for a net, fight with
        anything you can use.
